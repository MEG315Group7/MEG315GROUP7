## Hi there 👋
This code analyzes an integrated Anaerobic Digestion (AD) - Hydrothermal Carbonization (HTC) - Gas Turbine power generation system. The system converts organic waste into biogas through anaerobic digestion, processes residual biomass into hydrochar via hydrothermal carbonization, and generates electricity using a Brayton cycle gas turbine.

The backend comprises five core Python modules: BraytonCycle simulates the gas turbine thermodynamics with customizable pressure ratios (3-25), turbine inlet temperatures (800-1600K), and component efficiencies; ADSystem calculates biogas production using Buswell equations and kinetic models based on retention time and feedstock rates; HTCSystem models biomass conversion to hydrochar at subcritical water conditions (180-260°C); SystemOptimizer provides multi-objective optimization using genetic algorithms, gradient descent, and Pareto frontier analysis; and supporting modules for economic (NPV, LCOE) and environmental (carbon footprint) analysis.

The FastAPI backend exposes REST endpoints for calculations, scenario management, thermodynamic chart generation (h-s and T-Ḣ diagrams), and optimization. It serves a responsive HTML frontend with interactive parameter controls, real-time performance dashboards, and Chart.js visualizations.

Five predefined scenarios—Base Case, Optimized, Full COGAS, Minimal Config, and High Efficiency—demonstrate system performance ranging from 176-476 kW power output with 22-43% thermal efficiency. The system achieves waste-to-energy conversion with potential heat self-sufficiency through integrated heat recovery, supporting sustainability goals through carbon sequestration in hydrochar and reduced fossil fuel dependence.
